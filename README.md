# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

##Project description 

My aim for this project was to put my knowledge of python - including OOP principles, control flow, and functions - into practice, 
to develop a hangman game that a user can play. 

The key products of the project are:
- a Hangman class, whose methods and attributes are designed to enable a game of hangman
- a function that runs the game, and checks whether end conditions are met

Through delivering this project I have learned:
- important use cases for OOP principles
- how to iteratively improve code to achieve desired results


##usage instructions

Run milestone_5.py to play the hangman game. You will be asked to input letters, and will be given 
reminders of your progress. 


##File structure 

The repo contains 4 .py files:

- milestone_2.py
- milestone_3.py
- milestone_4.py
- milestone_5.py

milestone_2, milestone_3 and milestone_4 are documents that were used to develop code. 

milestone_5 should be considered the primary file.
