  num_lives: int
      represents the number of lives the user has left
  __word_list: str
      private attribute that represents the possible words the words to guess could have been chosen from
  list_of_guesses: str
      represents the letters a user has already guessed

  check_guess:
       Checks whether the letter guessed by the user is in the word. 
       Updates attributes accordingly.
